### Preparation of the cell culture medium
1.	Wipe sides of containers with ethanol 70% or other disinfectant before placing into waterbathb(also before placing into biosafety cabinet (BSC).
2.	Warm Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with high glucose (DMEM +D-glucose) and defrost Fetal Bovine serum(FBS), Penecillin-Streptavidin(PS), 200x Glutamine(Glut) in 37 °C bath. 
3.	The ratios of the final media are 10% FBS, 1% PS, and 2mM of Glut. Therefore, for 500mL of DMEM(4.5mg/mL D-Glucose), add 56.8ml of FBS, 5.68mL PS, 4.68ml of 200xGlutamine. At all times used serological pipettes and micropipettes of necessary. No pouring in BSC to avoid contamination.
5.	Take 0.22 µm filter bottle for media and transfer media into the bottle. 
6.	Connect the bottle to the vacuum suction to facilitate filtration.
7.	After aliquot into 2X 50 ml conical flasks and keep the bigger volume as a stock.

## Thawing a frozen HeLa cell stock

1.	Warm 50 mL of medium in 37 °C bath for 20-30 mins.
2.	While its warming, prepare working space and take cells from -140°C freezer and transport in ice box. 
3.	Defrost cells 37 °C bath for 2mins, or earlier if it defrosts faster. Make sure the lid is tight and the cryo-tube remains upright in the bath to avoid contamination.
4.	Prepare 7.6 ml of warm media(A) in 15mL conical flask
5.	Pour 0.8 ml into cryovial containing cells and collect evetything into 7.6 ml of prewarmed media(A)
6.	Take another 0.8 ml and wash the vial again to collect residues cells. Add into the prewarmed media (A) with rest of the cells. In total, you should obtain 10 ml volume.
7.	Centrifuge for 5 min at 1500 rpm
8.	Discard supernatant 
9.	Add 5ml of prewarmed media and do cell count (add formula). If number of cells is alright, add 5ml prewarmed media more, total volume of 10 mL
*If cell count is larger than 4x10^4 cellscm^2, dilute into two different T-75 
Flasks
2x105 cells/mL
9. Incubate the culture at 37°C incubator with 5% CO2. Cultures should be monitored daily.

## Cryopreservation procedure

Harvest cells in exponential growth. Not after a week end !
A good idea is to continue to maintain the cells in culture until the viability of
the recovered cells is confirmed!

1 T75cm2 flask = 2 or 3 vial of 1mL

1. Check your cell culture for contamination from bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, and viruses immediately before cryopreservation. In most cases, the results of the contamination screen will be available some time after the cultures are cryopreserved (10 to 14 days). If contamination is confirmed, then destroy the frozen material.

2. Prepare a freeze medium consisting of complete growth medium and from 5 to 10%
   DMSO. Keep in the fridge 4°C.

3. Collect cells by gentle centrifugation (10 minutes at 125 x g) and resuspend them in the freeze medium 4°C at a concentration of 1 x 10^6 to 5 x 106 viable cells/ml.

4. Label the appropriate number of vials with the name of the cell line and the date. Then add 1ml of the cell suspension to each of the vials and seal.

5. Allow cells to equilibrate in the freeze medium at room temperature for a minimum of 15 minutes but no longer than 40. This time is usually taken up in dispensing aliquots of the cell suspension into the vials.

After 40 minutes, cell viability may decline due to the DMSO. It's not necessary to work in ice.

6. Place the vials into polystyrene rack at -20°C, or place it in the chamber in a mechanical freezer at -70°C (or colder) for at least 24 hours.

7. After 24h, quickly transfer the vials to a liquid nitrogen or -80°C freezer. Frozen material
   will warm up at a rate of 10°C per minute and cells will deteriorate rapidly if warmed above -50°C.

8. After 24 hours at -80°C, remove one vial, restore the cells in culture medium, and determine their viability and sterility.
